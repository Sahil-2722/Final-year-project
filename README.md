1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Problem Definition

The problem addressed by this project lies in the need for an effective and intuitive tool for exploring and analyzing complex datasets. Traditional methods of data analysis often involve static visualizations or manual data manipulation, which can be time-consuming and lack interactivity. Moreover, as datasets grow in size and complexity, extracting meaningful insights becomes increasingly challenging.
This project seeks to tackle these challenges by developing a solution that offers interactive data exploration and analysis capabilities. The problem revolves around the absence of a comprehensive platform that allows users to dynamically interact with data, discover patterns, trends, and correlations, and perform comparative analyses seamlessly. Without such a tool, users may struggle to gain a deep understanding of their data, leading to suboptimal decision-making and missed opportunities for insights.
In summary, the problem statement for this project is the lack of an efficient and user-friendly tool for interactive data exploration and analysis, hindering users' ability to extract valuable insights from complex datasets and make informed decisions based on thorough analysis.

3.	Dependencies and Package Management:
•	Pandas: Pandas is a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrame and Series, which are efficient for handling structured data. Pandas facilitates tasks such as reading and writing data from various file formats (CSV, Excel, SQL databases), data cleaning, filtering, aggregation, and more. Its intuitive syntax and extensive functionality make it a go-to choice for data preprocessing and manipulation tasks.

•	Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a popular plotting library in Python used for creating static, interactive, and publication-quality visualizations. It offers a wide range of plot types, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, and more. Matplotlib provides fine-grained control over every aspect of a plot, from the axis labels and ticks to the color and style of plot elements. While it is powerful for creating static visualizations, it can be supplemented with other libraries like Plotly for interactive capabilities.

•	Plotly: Plotly is a versatile Python library for creating interactive visualizations, including charts, graphs, and dashboards. It offers a high level of interactivity, allowing users to zoom, pan, hover over data points for details, and toggle between different views dynamically. Plotly supports a wide range of plot types, including line charts, scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps, and more. Its integration with Pandas and Matplotlib makes it easy to use within existing workflows while providing additional interactive capabilities for exploring and analyzing data.

4.	Data Sources: Depending on project requirements, you may need additional software for accessing and managing data sources such as databases, APIs, or file formats like CSV, Excel, JSON, etc.
